# Cellular Automata Simulations

### Developers:

Felipe Vaiano Calderan

Gabriel Augusto Lins Leal Pinheiro

Silvio de Souza Neves Neto

### Why?

This was our final project of Theory of Computation subject.

So, don't expect the prettiest code there! :P

### Simulations:

This program "as-is" is capable of running 3 different kinds of simulations:

* [Elementary Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
* [John Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* [SIR Epidemiology Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model)

Each with some degree of customization. For more freedom in how the simulations work, we encourage that you
fork the project and modify the inner-workings. Most of the relevant variables can be found inside `main.js`.

### Dependencies:

This project depends on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/).

They are already integrated inside `libs` directory.

### How to run the program:

Open `index.html` in the browser.

**NOTE:** It's highly recommended to run in Mozilla Firefox or Firefox-based browsers, since the chart is known to have bugs in Chromium-based browsers.
